# Unity Binoculars Shader and Screen Effect

This project provides an example of how to implement a binoculars shader and screen effect in Unity. The shader simulates the effect of viewing the screen through binoculars, with adjustable zoom and distortion parameters. The screen effect applies the shader to the camera's output using the Unity Post-Processing stack.

This code is loosely based on Robert Rumney's binocular system, and is provided as an educational resource only.

## Usage

To use the binoculars shader and screen effect in your Unity project, follow these steps:

1. Import the contents of this repository into your Unity project.

2. Create a new material and assign the `Custom/Binoculars` shader to it.

3. Assign the texture you want to display to the `_MainTex` parameter of the material.

4. Adjust the `_Zoom` and `_Distortion` parameters of the material to achieve the desired binocular effect.

5. Create a new Post-Processing profile, and add the `Binoculars` effect to the profile.

6. Assign the `BinocularsEffect` script to the `Binoculars` effect.

7. Assign the Post-Processing profile to your camera.
